# Introduction

This repository contains a HTML slideshow for a talk I gave about making software tools at a [Cornwall Geeks](https://join.cornwallgeeks.net/) meetup in June 2017

The slides were created using [Deck JS](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) and also use an [extension](https://github.com/barraq/deck.ext.js)

All images are linked to URL's - some may have issues downloading.

Also included is the master_sequence_maker.sh example script discussed in the talk - you won't be able to use it.

No apologies for crap CSS, etc.
